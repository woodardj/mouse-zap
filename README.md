Mouse Zap!
=========

Global Game Jam 2014

"We see things not as they are, but as we are."

When the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. When you're an electric spark, all you understand is circuits and current. Wheny you're a fan, all you can see is the wind.

Using Unity (free version works), open mouseZap/Assets/MainMenuScene.unity and play. That's it!
