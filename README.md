Mouse Zap!
=========

Global Game Jam 2014

"We see things not as they are, but as we are."

When the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. When you're an electric spark, all you understand is circuits and current. Wheny you're a fan, all you can see is the wind.

Using Unity (free version works), open mouseZap/Assets/MainMenuScene.unity and play. That's it!

We've done a little cleanup post-jam to make sure we're showcasing the awesome audio work Ben did for us. If you want to  check out the code we submitted at the end of GGJ 2014, pull down the tag 'ggj-submission', or follow this link: https://github.com/woodardj/mouse-zap/tree/ggj-submission
